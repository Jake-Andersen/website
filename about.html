                        <h2>A brief description:</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>Hello, my name is Jake Andersen. I am currently in my fourth year as a senior student at Florida Southern College in Lakeland Florida studying Computer Science hoping to earn my Bachelor's Degree. I have a passion for Computer Science and technology in general and although I did not have much previous experience with these fields I am hopeful that I can learn as much as I am able to so that I can succsesfully apply my newfound skills in these disciplines to my life and eventual future career in the field.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>My skills:</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>So far I know a few programming languages but I do always have an interest to learn more. I especially would like to learn those that would be very useful and practical to know that I am yet unfamilair with, such as diving heavily into the C-based languages and language family. Although I still do have a general curiosity to learn some more unique langauges or even some much older languages like COBOL or Fortran (If I ever find the time). But as for now I have a good level of experience in a small variety of langauges that I have learned in my studies.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Of my general known langauges, thanks to my courses in the AI concentration I have a strong background and understanding of Python, with it being my most used language as of late and my strongest.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>However, out of general interest to take more CS classes in an attempt to learn useful skills, rather than just filling with classes out of my major, I have started to learn some web development and related languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. (Which made the existence of this site possible.)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <br>
                        <h2>Some interesting facts about me:</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <p>Before coming to study CS at college I had almost little to no experience with programming or CS topics.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>This website was built as a final project for an intro Web Development course where I had just learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>My favorite programming langauge is Python because of its simplicity and easy to use style and syntax.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Despite what this website might suggest I am not entirely a Web Development student, in fact I was more interested in and studied Artificial Intelligence in my program.</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Outside of programming and doing school work some of my favorite things to do are to play games with friends, video games or board games, and to spend time alone reading a good book (currently reading Don Quixote).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>I won a bronze medal at the ICPC programming contest one year (read more about it on my accomplishments page).</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>Personally I am more of a cat person and I have two pet cats that I love very much, but who also drive me crazy.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
